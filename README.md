# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass was the client for this project. My role was to be a systems analyst for the DriverPass project. DriverPass wanted our company to help them design a system that could provide online courses and driving license practice tests to students to help them better prepare for driving tests. 

# What did you do particularly well?
The “Objectives and Goals” portion of the business requirements document was very thorough. It helped to communicate the product vision and business needs for this project.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose to revise the technical requirements portion of the system design document. This is because I’m sure there’s much more technical requirements I could have included. I’m still learning and have very limited experience with the ins and outs of web-based systems, so I’m hoping I’m able to make a more informed suggestions in the future. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
We interpreted the user’s needs and implemented them into our design by ensuring that each requirement in our business requirements document worked towards fulfilling those needs. It’s important to consider the user’s needs when designing because the design directly effects the user experience. We want to ensure that every need can be met through our design and enhance the user experience as much as possible. 

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
We could approach designing software in this project by utilizing the object models to help developers take an object-oriented approach when developing the code for the system. I would use the strategy of collecting requirements and creating object and process models in the future to analyze and design a system.
